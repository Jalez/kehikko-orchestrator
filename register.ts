/**
 * Tell a host on this machine where this module answers.
 *
 *   bun run register            # or: PORT=7850 bun run register
 *
 * A separate program from `run.sh` on purpose. Registration writes into
 * somebody's home directory and says "frame this", which is a decision a person
 * makes once; a start script that did it quietly would be making that decision
 * on their behalf every time they pressed start. That argument is sharper for
 * this module than for the others, because what gets framed here has a button
 * that starts processes.
 *
 * ## The filename is the module id
 *
 * Not a field inside the file — the NAME. A host sweeps the directory and takes
 * the id from the filename, so `roadmap.orchestrator.json` is what makes this
 * `roadmap.orchestrator`. Two files naming the same port under different names
 * are two modules as far as a host is concerned.
 *
 * ## Where a host looks
 *
 * This line must say exactly what the host's own registry sweep says, and it is
 * copied rather than imported because this directory is meant to stand alone.
 * Writing to the wrong directory is the worst failure a module can have: the
 * host finds nothing, and finds it silently.
