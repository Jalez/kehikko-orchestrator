#
# The one name every module ships this under, so a host that offers to start one
# has a script to run rather than a command line to build.
#
#   - No arguments. A registration names a directory and one script inside it,
#     never a command line: a string a host handed to a shell would make a
#     registration file a place to write shell.
#   - $PORT from the environment. Whoever starts this chose the port; a script
#     that picked its own would answer somewhere nobody is looking. 7850 is the
#     default and the number in the registration — 7820, 7830 and 7840 belong to
#     References, Atlas and Journeys on this machine.
#   - `exec`, and the foreground. A script that forks and returns leaves whoever
#     started it holding a pid that stops nothing, and Stop is only ever offered
#     for what a host started.
#   - `cd` to this script's own directory, so the module runs beside its own
#     source however it was invoked.
#
# It does NOT register. Registration is a deliberate act by a person — see
# `register.ts` — and a start script that quietly wrote into somebody's home
# directory would be doing it on their behalf.
#
# ## $ORCHESTRATOR_DIRS, and why it is not set here
#
# This module starts Claude Code sessions, and the list of directories it may
# start one in comes from the environment of whoever starts this process. It is
# deliberately not defaulted in this file: a default here would be this script
# choosing a repository for somebody else's agent to edit, which is the one
# decision `scope.ts` refuses to make. Unset means the roster shows every
# session on the machine and the start button says, in words, which variable to
# set.
#
#     ORCHESTRATOR_DIRS=/Users/you/Projects/thing:/Users/you/Projects/other ./run.sh
#
# ## There is no build here, and no `dist`
#
# There was going to be. The argument for one is that starting should be
# starting: a start that shells out to a build is a start that fails when the
# network is down. The argument is fine and the shape is still wrong, because
# this program is not deployed — it runs on the machine of the person editing
# it. What `dist` actually buys is a STALE page served with a 200, every symptom
# of a working app and none of the changes, and that failure has cost this
# codebase whole afternoons three separate times in three different programs. A
# missing build announces itself. A stale one does not.
#
# So Vite serves the page, as Vite is for. The manifest, the health check and
# this module's own `/api` are middleware in front of the same server — see
# `doors()` in `vite.config.ts` — because a module is one origin or it is
# nothing, and because a page that fetched its own roster from a second port
# would be fetching it cross-origin.
